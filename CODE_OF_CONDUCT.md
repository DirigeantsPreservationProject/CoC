# Contributor Code of Conduct

* Contributions are weighed on merit alone. We do not care who you are, or what background you come from, nor will we ask you.

* When discussing an idea, we discuss the idea, not the person.

* The final say of any decision relating to the project, including overruling previous decisions, shall follow the hierarchy:
  1. The Executive Developer
  2. The Project Creator
  3. The Core Dev Team
  4. Any remaining Managing Members

* Authority is accrued proportionately with contributions. Anyone can earn seniority, but it must be earned.
  * Your relationship with any wider community of the project, and contributions to the said community are also counted as contributions to the project.
  * Negative contributions to the community similarly weigh against other positive merits you may have.

* Continued contributions are expected for continued membership of senior roles.

* Participation in this project and/or community indicate agreement to this code of conduct.

* Failure to adhere to this code of conduct will result in loss of status, seniority, and/or access to the project/community.
